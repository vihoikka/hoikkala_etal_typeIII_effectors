These profiles work with HMMER. The profile named all.hmm is a concatenation of all associated profiles. It has been hmmpressed, so is ready for use directly in the pipeline.

The HMM profiles are named by [signal_molecule]_[effector_version]_#[effector_family].hmm.

In case an effector does not have multiple homologous HMM profiles, the hashtag may be omitted.
